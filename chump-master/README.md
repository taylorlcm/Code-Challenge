# Chump Code Challenge
This is a barebones application whose structure is similar to the applications we use at Stukent. It is a `React.js` application with all the bells and whistles. This application resembles a chat application where a user enters a message and that message is sent to the server and then sent to other individuals / browsers on the same application.

## Getting Started:
1. Install the latest version of `node.js`
1. `git clone` this repository
1. `cd chump` on your local machine
1. `npm i` to install node modules.
1. `npm start` to start the development server
1. Go to `localhost:3031` in your browser and register.
1. Start hacking.

## Instructions:
Take this template and make it look and feel like a real application. It has the potential to be a nice chat application like Slack, HipChat, or Rocket Chat. It just needs a little love.

The tools used in this application are the current industry standard, and likely years ahead of what you're used to. **Do not panic.** Ask questions. Search the internet. Work the problem.
